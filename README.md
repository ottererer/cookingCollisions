# Recipe for Disaster

Instructions:
- As you play, orders will appear at the top of the screen, each with a timer.
- You must combine different particles in order to create the right ones, and avoid running out of time.
- Check your recipe book (Q) in order to learn which steps you must take.
- The recipe book displays the recipes as a directed graph, which you must following from left right.
- You make new compounds by either performing an action on a particle (chopping or frying), or by combining two different particles.
- What you need to do is indicated by the recipe book. E.g. a chopping board means you need to chop it.
- Compounds are combined by placing them on the same counter/plate.
- Items are chopped by placing them on a chopping board and chopping, or fried by placing them on a frying pan and waiting for 5 seconds.
- When you have successfully created the ordered compound, you must submit it, at a submission device at the top of the screen.
- If you successfully deliver an order, you gain some time back, as well as some score.
- If you deliver the wrong compound, or run out of time on an order, you will receive a time penalty.
- If you make a mistake in your order, you can throw out the particles by putting them in a bin (black circle).
- The rate at which new orders appear will increase as you play. Memorizing recipes is crucial to succeed.
